        <h2> Content One</h2>
        <p>Pokémon,[a][1][2][3] also known as Pocket Monsters[b] in Japan, is a Japanese media franchise managed by The
            Pokémon Company, a company founded by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. The franchise was created by
            Satoshi Tajiri in 1995,[4] and is centered on fictional creatures called "Pokémon", which humans, known as
            Pokémon Trainers, catch and train to battle each other for sport. Works within the franchise are set in the
            Pokémon universe. The English slogan for the franchise is "Gotta Catch 'Em All".[5][6]</p>
        <h3> Content Two</h3>
        <p>The franchise began as Pocket Monsters Red and Green (later released outside of Japan as Pokémon Red and
            Blue), a pair of video games for the original Game Boy handheld system that were developed by Game Freak and
            published by Nintendo in February 1996. It soon became a media mix franchise adapted into various different
            media.[7] Pokémon has since become the highest-grossing media franchise of all time,[8][9][10] with $90
            billion in total franchise revenue.[11][12] The original video game series is the second-best-selling video
            game franchise (behind Nintendo's Mario franchise)[13] with more than 368 million copies sold[14] and one
            billion mobile downloads,[15] and it spawned a hit anime television series that has become the most
            successful video game adaptation[16] with over 20 seasons and 1,000 episodes in 169 countries.</p>
