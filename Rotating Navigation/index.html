            <h1>Learning Javascript</h1>
            <small>Vishwas Anavatti</small>
            <p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[6] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the
                ECMAScript specification.[7] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.
                It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class
                functions.

                Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[8] JavaScript
                enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of
                websites use it for client-side page behavior,[9] and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript
                engine to execute it.
            </p>
            <h3>How is it going?</h3>
            <p>As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming
                styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular
                expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM). However, the language itself
                does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, as the
                host environment (usually a web browser) provides those APIs.

                JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now embedded in some servers,
                usually via Node.js. They are also embedded in a variety of applications created with frameworks such as
                Electron and Cordova.

                Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and
                respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>
